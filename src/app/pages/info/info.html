<h1>About</h1>
<h2>Welcome to my App Store Showcase</h2>
<p>
  This application was designed to demonstrate my proficiency in building
  modern, scalable web interfaces using Angular and Angular Material.

<p>
  More than just a visual demo, this project reflects my approach to software
  development: creating clean, intuitive user experiences backed by robust,
  component-based architecture.
</p>
<p>
  It features a responsive layout, seamless navigation, and a refined UI
  inspired by industry standards.
</p>
<p>
  As a developer, I focus on writing maintainable code and leveraging the full
  potential of the Angular ecosystem to solve complex problems.
