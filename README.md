# My App Store

> **Developer Note:** This application was designed to demonstrate my proficiency in building modern, scalable web interfaces using Angular and Angular Material. More than just a visual demo, this project reflects my approach to software development: creating clean, intuitive user experiences backed by robust, component-based architecture.

It features a responsive layout, seamless navigation, and a refined UI inspired by industry standards. As a developer, I focus on writing maintainable code and leveraging the full potential of the Angular ecosystem to solve complex problems.

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

This project leverages the cutting-edge features of **Angular 20** to deliver a high-performance, maintainable frontend architecture.

### Core Architecture & State
- **Zoneless Change Detection:** Implemented `provideZonelessChangeDetection()` for superior performance and smaller bundle sizes, moving away from traditional Zone.js overhead.
- **Standalone Architecture:** Fully modular design using Angular's latest Standalone Components API.
- **Advanced Routing:** Optimized with `PreloadAllModules` strategy to ensure seamless navigation while keeping initial load times minimal.

### UI & UX Components
- **Angular Material & CDK:** Utilized for high-quality, accessible UI components (Data tables, navigation, and overlays).
- **Interactive Galleries:** Integrated **PhotoSwipe** for professional-grade image interaction and **Swiper** for modern, touch-optimized carousels.
- **Custom Build Scripts:** Automated gallery manifest generation via custom Node.js scripts to streamline the asset pipeline.

### Engineering Practices
- **Reactive Programming:** Extensive use of **RxJS** for handling asynchronous data streams and HTTP requests.
- **Type Safety:** Built with **TypeScript 5.8**, ensuring strict typing and robust code quality.
- **Code Quality:** Prettier integration with custom Angular HTML parsing for consistent code formatting across the team.
